# eclectic
Eclectic started off as a photomosaic generator. However, after finding out how ambitious such a project is given GTK#'s current (unfortunately, abysmal) state, it's become a statistical tool for image galleries. I eventually want to evolve it into a tool for managing image libraries.

# Features - Real
These are all features which are implmented, but not necessarily exposed by the program in any way (yet)

* Image similarity indexing
* Average color calculation
* Bitmap region selection
* Flexible directory search
